# HugeGraph HStore Helm Chart

[Apache HugeGraph](https://hugegraph.apache.org/) - an open source, distributed graph database.

## Quick Start

The beginner-friendly default is 3 PD + 3 Store + 3 Server + 1 Hubble on an
existing Kubernetes cluster. Hubble is a single-replica UI. The
`values-cluster.yaml` preset enables authentication, PD discovery, and Hubble
persistence; `values-single.yaml` provides the same defaults for a smaller
development cluster.

### Prerequisites

- Helm 3 and Kubernetes 1.23+
- `kubectl` configured for the target cluster
- A default StorageClass, or explicit PD and Store `storageClassName` values
- Enough memory for 10 processes in the default topology
- PD, Store, Server, and Hubble images available to every Kubernetes node

### 1. Check the cluster

Confirm that `kubectl` points to the cluster where HugeGraph should run and
that it can provision persistent volumes:

```bash
kubectl config current-context
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get storageclass
```

If there is no default StorageClass, set `pd.storage.storageClassName`,
`store.storage.storageClassName`, and `hubble.persistence.storageClassName` in
your values file. The default topology needs 3 PD PVCs, 3 Store PVCs, and 1
Hubble PVC when persistence is enabled.

### 2. Make images available to Kubernetes

The chart does not build images. The default values pull the published images
from Docker Hub, so no local build or image-loading step is needed:

| Component | Default image | Pull policy |
|---|---|---|
| PD | `hugegraph/pd:helm-dev` | `IfNotPresent` |
| Store | `hugegraph/store:helm-dev` | `IfNotPresent` |
| Server | `hugegraph/server:helm-dev` | `IfNotPresent` |
| Hubble | `hugegraph/hubble:latest` | `Always` |

If your cluster uses a private registry, override the image repository, tag,
and pull policy in a values file before installing.

### 3. Configure authentication

Authentication and Hubble are enabled by default. When
`server.auth.admin.existingSecret` and `server.auth.admin.password` are empty,
the chart creates a random password in `hugegraph-admin` and keeps that Secret
across uninstall. The password is stable across Helm upgrades and is not
printed by the install notes; users who can read the Kubernetes Secret or Helm
release can still retrieve it.

View the generated password after installation:

```bash
kubectl -n hugegraph get secret hugegraph-admin \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode; printf '\n'
```

Keep the output private. For a custom Secret, create it before installation
and set `server.auth.admin.existingSecret`; it always takes priority and the
chart does not overwrite or manage that Secret:

```bash
kubectl create namespace hugegraph --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl -n hugegraph create secret generic my-hugegraph-admin \
  --from-literal=password='CHANGE_ME'
```

Add `--set-string server.auth.admin.existingSecret=my-hugegraph-admin` to the
install command in step 4. The Secret must contain a `password` key without
newlines, carriage returns, backslashes, or leading whitespace. Alternatively,
set `server.auth.admin.password` for an inline value (prefer a Secret in
shared clusters).

The JWT signing key uses the same shape under `server.auth.token`
(`value` / `existingSecret` / `autoGenerate`).

### 4. Install 3+3+3+1

```bash
helm upgrade --install hugegraph ./helm/hugegraph \
  --namespace hugegraph \
  --create-namespace \
  -f ./helm/hugegraph/values-cluster.yaml \
  --wait --timeout 15m
```

For a smaller development deployment, replace `values-cluster.yaml` with
`values-single.yaml`. It deploys 1 PD + 1 Store + 1 Server + 1 Hubble.

### 5. Test and connect

```bash
helm test hugegraph --namespace hugegraph
kubectl get pods,pvc -n hugegraph
```

Forward the Server API and Hubble UI in separate terminals:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n hugegraph svc/hugegraph-server 8080:8080
kubectl port-forward -n hugegraph svc/hugegraph-hubble 8088:8088
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8088> and sign in as `admin`. The Server API is at
<http://127.0.0.1:8080/versions>.

### Common parameters

| Area | Values | Cluster preset |
|---|---|---|
| Replicas | `pd.replicas`, `store.replicas`, `server.replicas` | `3`, `3`, `3` |
| Images | `*.image.repository`, `*.image.tag`, `*.image.pullPolicy` | Docker Hub PD/Store/Server `helm-dev`, Hubble `latest` |
| Resources | `pd.resources`, `store.resources`, `server.resources`, `hubble.resources` | Explicit requests and limits |
| Storage | `pd.storage.*`, `store.storage.*`, `hubble.persistence.*` | `10Gi`, `50Gi`, `1Gi` PVC |
| Authentication | `server.auth.enabled`, `server.auth.admin.*`, `server.auth.token.*` | `true`, chart-managed admin + JWT |
| Hubble | `hubble.enabled`, `hubble.mode`, `hubble.port` | `true`, `pd`, `8088` |

`values-cluster.yaml` is a starting point, not a capacity guarantee. Recalculate
CPU, memory, replica placement, storage class, and storage size for production.

## Documentation

This chart deploys a distributed HugeGraph cluster - PD, Store, and Server - on
Kubernetes. For HugeGraph itself see <https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/>.

Note that this chart requires Helm 3. `--reset-then-reuse-values`, referenced
under Upgrading, requires Helm 3.14 or later.

## Prerequisites Details

* Kubernetes 1.23+ (the chart renders `autoscaling/v2` and `policy/v1`)
* PV support on the underlying infrastructure: a default StorageClass, or an
  explicit `storageClassName` for PD and Store
* Sufficient memory for 10 processes in the default topology, including Hubble.
  Insufficient memory causes OOM kills that surface as silent Raft failures
  rather than as clear errors.

## Chart Details

| Component | Workload | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| PD | StatefulSet + PVC | Placement driver; Raft group tracking Stores and partitions |
| Store | StatefulSet + PVC | Graph data storage (HStore) |
| Server | Deployment | Gremlin and REST query layer |
| Hubble | Single-replica Deployment, optional PVC | Web UI and cluster operations view |

A distributed HugeGraph cluster has a startup contract that this chart encodes
so operators do not have to:

- **Server does not run `init-store`.** The chart injects
  `HG_SERVER_INIT_STORE_ENABLED=false`, and the image's `init-store` exits when
  `init_store.enabled=false`, after which Server registers with PD normally.
  This matters because nothing serializes Server replicas: without the gate,
  every replica would initialize the same backend concurrently. The chart
  creates no init Job and does not set `HG_SERVER_SKIP_INIT`. Standalone
  behavior is unchanged, because the option defaults to `true` when unset.
- **Store waits for PD quorum** in an init container before starting, so Store
  never registers against an incomplete PD Raft group.
- **The Server startup probe allows at least 450 seconds.** The image may spend
  300 seconds waiting for storage and a further 120 seconds in the start
  command. A lower configured `failureThreshold` is raised to this floor rather
  than being rejected.
- **The wrapper writes `auth.admin_pa` from the auth Secret.** With
  `init_store.enabled=false` the admin credential is created on the PD startup
  path from `auth.admin_pa`, not from the Docker `PASSWORD` stdin path. When
  authentication is enabled, the chart's wrapper therefore writes
  `auth.admin_pa` from the mounted Secret alongside `usePD=true` and
  `pd.peers`, then hands off to the image entrypoint. Two caveats:
  `auth.admin_pa` applies only when the admin is first created, so changing the
  Secret does not rotate an existing cluster's password, and the value lands in
  `rest-server.properties` inside the container (file mode 600). Because the
  Java properties parser reinterprets them, the Secret value must not contain
  newlines, carriage returns, or backslashes; the wrapper refuses to start if
  it does.
- **Resource names reserve their suffix and StatefulSet ordinal before
  truncation,** so a long release name cannot produce colliding or over-long
  Pod and Service names, and PD/Store identities stay fixed when replicas
  change.

## Installing the Chart

```bash
helm install hugegraph ./helm/hugegraph --namespace hugegraph --create-namespace
```

This deploys the default 3 PD + 3 Store + 3 Server + 1 Hubble topology on the
current Kubernetes context. It generates the admin Secret automatically; use
`values-cluster.yaml` to add production-oriented JVM/resource settings, PDBs,
anti-affinity, and Hubble persistence.

The default anti-affinity for `pd`, `store`, and `server` is `preferred`
(Server always was; Hubble has no anti-affinity knob because it is
single-replica by design), so the chart schedules even on clusters with
fewer nodes than replicas. Production should pin `pd.antiAffinity` and
`store.antiAffinity` to `required`, as `values-cluster.yaml` does, so one
node failure cannot take out the PD quorum or co-locate shard replicas; see
Scheduling below.

A fresh install seeds PD with a partition shard count of 3 when
`store.replicas` is at least 3, and 1 otherwise, instead of the image
default of 1. The seed applies at first bootstrap only; see Partition
Sharding below.

This first chart is version `0.1.0`. On this development branch, PD, Store,
and Server default to Docker Hub images tagged `helm-dev` with
`pullPolicy: IfNotPresent`. Hubble still tracks
`hugegraph/hubble:latest` with `Always` (source is in `hugegraph-toolchain`).
Before stable publication, pin all component tags and `appVersion` to the next
HugeGraph release.

Verify the release:

```bash
helm test hugegraph --namespace hugegraph
```

### Values Presets

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `values.yaml` | Default 3+3+3+1 topology with preferred anti-affinity, authentication, automatic admin Secret, and Hubble in `pd` mode |
| `values-single.yaml` | Single-node 1+1+1+1 development preset with the same authentication and Hubble defaults |
| `values-cluster.yaml` | Production 3+3+3+1 starting point with JVM/resources, PD/Store PDBs, required anti-affinity, authentication, and Hubble persistence |

`values-cluster.yaml` is a production starting point, not a capacity
guarantee. Recalculate capacity for the graph size, traffic, failure budget,
node topology, and storage class before production use.

### Optional local Kubernetes environments (Kind / minikube)

The following section is only for users who do not already have a Kubernetes
cluster. If you already have one, follow Quick Start and skip this section.

The normal chart defaults pull PD, Store, and Server from Docker Hub. To test
local PD, Store, and Server builds instead, build those three images, load them
into the cluster, and override their tags and pull policies during install.
Hubble still pulls `hugegraph/hubble:latest`. Current Hubble images need
`server.auth`. The Quick Start generates the admin Secret when no existing
Secret is supplied and reuses an existing Secret first.

```bash
# Kind
kind create cluster --name hg

docker build -f hugegraph-pd/Dockerfile -t hugegraph/pd:local .
docker build -f hugegraph-store/Dockerfile -t hugegraph/store:local .
docker build -f hugegraph-server/Dockerfile-hstore -t hugegraph/server:local .

kind load docker-image hugegraph/pd:local hugegraph/store:local \
  hugegraph/server:local --name hg

# minikube: minikube image load hugegraph/pd:local \
#   hugegraph/store:local hugegraph/server:local

helm upgrade --install hugegraph ./helm/hugegraph \
  --namespace hugegraph \
  --create-namespace \
  -f helm/hugegraph/values-single.yaml \
  --set pd.image.tag=local --set pd.image.pullPolicy=Never \
  --set store.image.tag=local --set store.image.pullPolicy=Never \
  --set server.image.tag=local --set server.image.pullPolicy=Never
```

Server uses `Dockerfile-hstore` so the image default backend is HStore. Skip
`kind load` / `minikube image load` and the Pods fail with `ErrImageNeverPull`.
Do not reuse Docker Hub `hugegraph/*:latest` under the `local` tag.

#### Authentication (local / auth-enabled install)

The Quick Start generates `hugegraph-admin` when no admin password or existing
Secret is available. Set `server.auth.admin.existingSecret` to use a custom
Secret instead; the chart never overwrites or manages that Secret. The
generated Secret is kept by Helm so a later install of the same release reuses
the same password.

Steps:

1. Create a Secret whose name you will pass as
   `server.auth.admin.existingSecret`. The Secret must contain the key
   `password` (no newlines, carriage returns, or backslashes).
2. Install or upgrade with `server.auth.admin.existingSecret` set to that
   Secret name. `server.auth.enabled` remains `true`.
3. Log in to Hubble or the REST API as `admin` with that password.

```bash
kubectl -n hugegraph create secret generic my-hugegraph-admin \
  --from-literal=password='CHANGE_ME'

helm install hugegraph ./helm/hugegraph \
  --namespace hugegraph \
  --create-namespace \
  -f helm/hugegraph/values-single.yaml \
  --set-string server.auth.admin.existingSecret=my-hugegraph-admin
```

The Secret sets `auth.admin_pa` only when the admin account is first created.
Changing the Secret later does not rotate an existing cluster password. With
authentication disabled, leave `server.auth.admin.existingSecret` and
`server.auth.admin.password` empty.

## Upgrading the Chart

```bash
helm upgrade hugegraph ./helm/hugegraph --namespace hugegraph --reuse-values
```

Every optional field stays optional, so a release created by an earlier
revision continues to render under `--reuse-values`. Note that `--reuse-values`
keeps the old release's values as the complete base, so a release created
before a field existed does **not** pick up its new default, including the
hardened `securityContext`, ServiceAccounts, and `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`.
Use `-f` with your own values, or `--reset-then-reuse-values`, to adopt them.
That rule covers values-sourced defaults only; the asymmetry is that
template-derived settings **are** applied even under `--reuse-values`,
because they are computed at render time from whatever values are in effect.
Pod-level token mounting (disabled unconditionally) and the derived
`-Dpartition.default-shard-count` in the PD `JAVA_OPTS` are the current
cases. On an already-initialized cluster the seeded shard count is inert
either way; see Partition Sharding.

Upgrading an existing release to this chart version rolls the PD StatefulSet
once: PD Pods now always carry a `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable with the
chart-derived partition properties, where previous versions set the variable
only when `pd.javaOpts` was non-empty.

The `pd.antiAffinity` and `store.antiAffinity` defaults changed from
`required` to `preferred` in this version. `--reuse-values` keeps the old
effective value, but installs that relied on the old `required` default
while supplying their own values files must now pin `antiAffinity: required`
explicitly.

PD and Store resource names reserve room for their StatefulSet ordinal before truncation, so
identities stay fixed across replica changes and scaling never renames a
PersistentVolumeClaim.

The chart-managed authentication Secret is kept on uninstall and reused by a
later install of the same release name. Do not delete it unless you intend to
manage the password separately. `helm template` and client-side dry-runs cannot
read an existing Secret, so their generated password is only a render-time
placeholder; a live install or upgrade uses the existing Secret when Helm has
permission to read it.

## Uninstalling the Chart

```bash
helm uninstall hugegraph --namespace hugegraph
```

Helm does not remove PersistentVolumeClaims created by StatefulSets. Delete
them explicitly, and only when the data is no longer needed.

| `store.podSecurityContext` | Pod-level securityContext, rendered only when set | `{}` |
| `store.securityContext` | Container-level securityContext; also applied to the PD-quorum init container. Hardened by default; `runAsNonRoot` is not set because the published images run as root | `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `capabilities.drop: [ALL]`, `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault` |
| `store.waitTimeoutSeconds` | Bound on the PD-quorum wait before the init container fails | `900` |

| `server.auth.admin.key` | Key inside the admin password Secret | `password` |
| `server.auth.admin.autoGenerate` | Create and keep a random release-admin Secret when password and existingSecret are empty | `true` |
| `server.auth.token.value` | Optional inline JWT signing key; prefer a Secret in shared clusters | `""` |
| `server.auth.token.existingSecret` | Pre-created Secret for the JWT signing key (`auth.token_secret`) | `""` |
| `server.auth.token.key` | Key inside the JWT signing Secret | `token_secret` |
| `server.auth.token.autoGenerate` | Create and keep a random release-auth-token Secret when value and existingSecret are empty | `true` |
| `server.ingress.enabled` | Create an Ingress for the Server Service | `false` |
| `server.ingress.className` | IngressClass name | `""` |
| `server.ingress.annotations` | Ingress annotations (cert-manager, nginx, ALB) | `{}` |

| `server.service.annotations` | Server Service annotations | `{}` |
| `server.ingress.hosts` | Ingress hosts and paths | see `values.yaml` |
| `server.ingress.tls` | Ingress TLS configuration | `[]` |
| `server.hpa.enabled` | Create a HorizontalPodAutoscaler | `false` |
| `server.hpa.minReplicas` | HPA minimum replicas | `3` |
| `server.hpa.maxReplicas` | HPA maximum replicas | `10` |
| `server.hpa.targetCPUUtilizationPercentage` | HPA CPU utilization target | `70` |
| `server.probes.startup.failureThreshold` | Raised automatically so the budget is at least 450s | `90` |
| `server.probes.startup.periodSeconds` | Startup probe interval | `5` |
| `server.probes.*` | Same optional probe keys as PD | see `values.yaml` |

When `server.hpa.enabled` is `true` the Deployment omits `spec.replicas`, so a
Helm upgrade does not overwrite the autoscaler's live replica count. Enabling
utilization-based HPA requires a strictly positive
`server.resources.requests.cpu`.



### Reaching Hubble (pick one path)

Most people should stop at **1**. Use **2** only if Hubble must run outside
the cluster. Use **3** only if that outside Hubble must discover Server through
PD. Store Operations metrics from outside the cluster are out of scope here.

#### 1. In-cluster Hubble (recommended)

Leave `hubble.enabled=true` (the default). The chart wires PD/Server for you.

Open the UI with one port-forward:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> port-forward svc/<release>-hugegraph-hubble 8088:8088
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8088`. For a shared environment, expose Hubble with
`hubble.service.type` NodePort/LoadBalancer or `hubble.ingress` instead of
port-forward. Log in with the chart admin password from the NOTES / admin
Secret.

This is the average-user path: no Docker, no advertise URL, no PD peer list.

#### 2. Outside Hubble, direct Server URL (simple external)

Use this when Hubble runs on a host or VM outside the cluster, and you only
need graph / schema / data / Gremlin (not PD discovery).

1. Install with in-chart Hubble off: `--set hubble.enabled=false`.
2. Expose Server (`server.service.type` NodePort/LoadBalancer, or Ingress).
3. Run a standalone Hubble image with `pd.enabled=false` and
   `server.direct_url` set to that reachable Server URL (match Server auth).
4. Open the standalone Hubble port in a browser (or SSH tunnel to it).

Example property fragment for the standalone process:

```properties
pd.enabled=false
server.direct_url=http://<reachable-server-host>:<port>
```

Mount the file at `/hubble/conf/hugegraph-hubble.properties` inside the
official image (workdir is `/hubble`). One Server URL is enough; you do not
need to expose PD.

#### 3. Outside Hubble, PD discovery (advanced)

Use this when an outside Hubble must ask PD for the Server address.

In-cluster names such as `*.svc` are not reachable from outside. The chart
helps with two knobs: advertise a reachable Server URL to PD, and expose the
PD client Service.

Keep **`server.auth.enabled=true`**. With `hubble.enabled=false`, auth-on is
what enables PD meta mode so the chart actually writes `server.urls_to_pd`
(and therefore honors `server.advertiseUrl`). Auth-off plus `advertiseUrl`
fails at render time.

1. Install with `--set hubble.enabled=false` and keep `server.auth.enabled=true`.
2. Expose Server and set `server.advertiseUrl` to the absolute `http(s)://`
   URL outside Hubble will use after discovery. The chart registers it via
   `server.urls_to_pd` instead of the in-cluster Service URL.
3. Expose PD (`pd.service.type` NodePort/LoadBalancer) so Hubble can dial PD
   REST and gRPC.
4. Run standalone Hubble with `pd.enabled=true` and `pd.peers` / `pd.server`
   pointed at those external PD addresses. Mount config at
   `/hubble/conf/hugegraph-hubble.properties`.

Example property fragment:

```properties
pd.enabled=true
pd.peers=<reachable-pd-host>:<grpc-port>
pd.server=<reachable-pd-host>:<rest-port>
```

Trade-off: when `server.advertiseUrl` is set, PD returns that same URL to
every discovery client, including an in-cluster Hubble. Leave it empty for the
default in-cluster path.

Local quick test (cluster and Hubble on the same machine): port-forward Server
`8080` and PD client `8620`/`8686`, set
`server.advertiseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:8080`, run standalone Hubble with
`--network host` and the PD properties above, then open Hubble on `8088`
(or SSH `-L 8088:127.0.0.1:8088` from a laptop).

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `server.advertiseUrl` | Absolute Server URL registered with PD for discovery clients. Empty uses the in-cluster Server Service URL | `""` |
| `pd.service.type` | PD client Service type (`ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer`) | `ClusterIP` |
| `pd.service.annotations` | Annotations on the PD client Service | `{}` |
| `pd.service.restNodePort` | Optional fixed NodePort for PD REST; requires NodePort/LoadBalancer | unset |
| `pd.service.grpcNodePort` | Optional fixed NodePort for PD gRPC; requires NodePort/LoadBalancer | unset |

### Hubble UI

How to open Hubble (in-cluster vs outside) is under
[Reaching Hubble](#reaching-hubble-pick-one-path) above. This section covers
chart wiring and parameters.

The presets deploy [HugeGraph Hubble](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/quickstart/toolchain/hugegraph-hubble/),
the web UI for graph management, schema browsing, Gremlin queries, and the
cluster operations view. `hubble.mode` selects the wiring. In the default
`pd` mode the chart points `pd.peers` at the PD gRPC peers, `pd.server` at
the PD client Service REST port, and the Store metrics allow-list at the
Store REST endpoints, so the cluster view works without manual wiring; the
Server is additionally configured to register its client Service URL with PD
(see below). In `direct` mode Hubble only receives `server.direct_url`
pointing at the Server client Service; there is no PD discovery and no
operations view. Everything else in `hugegraph-hubble.properties` keeps the
image default.

Enabling `pd`-mode Hubble switches the Server into PD meta mode (`usePD`,
`server.urls_to_pd`, `server.deploy_in_k8s`) so that PD can hand Hubble a
resolvable Server address; auth-enabled installs already run in this mode.
On an existing release this change rolls the Server Deployment once. The
Store allow-list is computed from `store.replicas` at render time, so scale
Store with `helm upgrade`, not `kubectl scale`, or the list goes stale until
the next upgrade.

Hubble is one replica by design: it keeps UI connection metadata, including
any graph credentials entered in the UI, in an embedded per-instance H2
database. Enable `hubble.persistence` to keep that metadata across Pod
replacement; the chart then redirects the H2 location into the mounted
volume through Spring's environment binding. The Deployment uses the
`Recreate` strategy so two Hubble instances never attach the same database.
The PVC is kept on `helm uninstall` (delete it explicitly to discard the
stored metadata), `size` and `storageClassName` apply at install time only,
and a non-root `podSecurityContext` needs a matching `fsGroup` so H2 can
write the volume.

**Hubble uses Server authentication.** Current Hubble images gate the UI
behind a login that authenticates against the cluster; with Server
authentication disabled the login cannot complete. The chart enables both
authentication and Hubble by default, generates the admin credential when no
`admin.existingSecret` or `admin.password` is supplied, and refuses to render Hubble without auth unless
`hubble.allowWithoutServerAuth=true` explicitly overrides it for images whose
login does not need cluster authentication.

**Hubble serves plain HTTP.** Reach it with `kubectl port-forward` or behind
an HTTPS-terminating Ingress; never expose the port directly to an untrusted
network. An Ingress without `tls` is rejected at render time unless
`hubble.ingress.allowPlainHttp=true` explicitly accepts plain HTTP for a
trusted network.

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `hubble.enabled` | Deploy the Hubble UI. Requires `server.auth` (see below) | `true` |
| `hubble.mode` | `pd` discovers the cluster through PD and enables the operations view; `direct` talks to the Server client Service only | `pd` |
| `hubble.allowWithoutServerAuth` | Renders Hubble without `server.auth`, for future images whose login does not require cluster authentication | `false` |
| `hubble.image.repository` | Hubble image repository | `hugegraph/hubble` |
| `hubble.image.tag` | Hubble image tag. Tracks the development image until the next release is pinned | `latest` |
| `hubble.image.pullPolicy` | Hubble image pull policy | `Always` |
| `hubble.port` | Hubble HTTP port, container port, and Service port | `8088` |
| `hubble.persistence.enabled` | Persist UI connection metadata in a PVC | `false` |
| `hubble.persistence.size` | PVC size | `1Gi` |
| `hubble.persistence.storageClassName` | Empty uses the cluster default StorageClass | `""` |
| `hubble.resources` | Hubble resources | `{}` |
| `hubble.podSecurityContext` | Pod-level securityContext, rendered only when set | `{}` |
| `hubble.securityContext` | Container-level securityContext, hardened like the other components | see `values.yaml` |
| `hubble.service.type` | Hubble Service type | `ClusterIP` |
| `hubble.service.annotations` | Hubble Service annotations | `{}` |
| `hubble.service.nodePort` | Requires a `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` Service type | unset |
| `hubble.ingress.*` | Same Ingress keys as `server.ingress.*`, plus `allowPlainHttp`, which applies to the Hubble Ingress only | `enabled: false` |
| `hubble.serviceAccount.*` | Same ServiceAccount keys as the other components | `create: true` |
| `hubble.nodeSelector` / `tolerations` / `affinity` / `topologySpreadConstraints` | Scheduling controls | unset |
| `hubble.priorityClassName` | PriorityClass for the hubble Pod | `""` |
| `hubble.podAnnotations` / `hubble.podLabels` | Extra Pod metadata | `{}` |
| `hubble.extraEnv` | Extra environment variables for the hubble container | `[]` |
| `hubble.terminationGracePeriodSeconds` | Shutdown grace period | `30` |
| `hubble.probes.*` | Same probe keys as PD; startup and readiness check `/actuator/health`, liveness is a TCP check | see `values.yaml` |

Specify each parameter with `--set`, or supply a YAML file with `-f`:

```bash
helm install hugegraph ./helm/hugegraph --set server.replicas=5
```

`values.schema.json` and template helpers reject invalid input at render time,
before anything reaches the cluster:

- Unknown keys and wrong types are rejected.
- `server.initStoreEnabled` must remain `false` for a distributed deployment.
- With authentication enabled, either `server.auth.admin.existingSecret` must
  name a Secret containing the configured key (default `password`), or
  `server.auth.admin.password` must be set, or `server.auth.admin.autoGenerate`
  must be true. The same shape applies to `server.auth.token` (`existingSecret`
  / `value` / `autoGenerate`). With authentication disabled,
  `admin.existingSecret`, `admin.password`, `token.existingSecret`, and
  `token.value` must be empty, so a configured but inactive Secret reference
  cannot be overlooked. A missing Secret fails when Kubernetes configures the
  container; an empty `password` fails in the Server startup wrapper.
- `server.hpa.minReplicas` must not exceed `maxReplicas`, and enabling
  utilization-based HPA requires a strictly positive
  `server.resources.requests.cpu`.
- `pdb.minAvailable` must be less than the matching `replicas`, so a
  PodDisruptionBudget cannot permanently block node drains.
- `pd.pdb.minAvailable` must also be at least the PD Raft majority,
  `floor(replicas/2)+1`, so the budget cannot permit evictions that drop PD
  below quorum. With 2 PD replicas no valid budget exists (the majority is
  the whole membership); disable the PD PDB or use an odd replica count.
- `extraEnv` must not set chart-managed variable names (for example
  `HG_SERVER_INIT_STORE_ENABLED` or the PD/Store identity and topology
  variables): entries render after the chart-owned variables and the last
  duplicate wins, so an override would silently bypass a validated contract.
  `JAVA_OPTS` and `JAVA_OPTIONS` are reserved for the same reason: the
  component start scripts skip automatic heap sizing and drop the chart's
  `JAVA_OPTS` flags entirely when `JAVA_OPTIONS` arrives preset.
- `pd.replicas` and `store.replicas` are capped at 99.
- `pd.partition.defaultShardCount` and `pd.partition.storeMaxShardCount`
  must each be empty or a positive integer. An explicit shard count must
  also be odd (PD's config API rejects even values, and PD clamps 2 to 1)
  and must not exceed `store.replicas`, past which PD would silently clamp
  it to the live store count.
- `hubble.port` must be a valid port, `hubble.persistence.size` must be
  non-empty, and `hubble.service.nodePort` requires a `NodePort` or
  `LoadBalancer` Service type.
- `hubble.image.tag` must be non-empty (the chart `appVersion` tracks the
  Server release, not Hubble), and a Hubble Ingress without `tls` is rejected
  unless `hubble.ingress.allowPlainHttp=true`.
- `hubble.enabled` without `server.auth.enabled` is rejected unless
  `hubble.allowWithoutServerAuth=true`, and setting
  `server.ingress.allowPlainHttp` is rejected because the plain-HTTP opt-in
  applies to the Hubble Ingress only.

## Deep Dive

### Connecting to the Cluster

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n hugegraph svc/hugegraph-server 8080:8080
PASSWORD="$(kubectl -n hugegraph get secret hugegraph-admin \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode)"
curl --user "admin:${PASSWORD}" http://127.0.0.1:8080/versions
curl --user "admin:${PASSWORD}" http://127.0.0.1:8080/graphs
```

### Cluster Health

| Component | Port | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| PD | `8686` | gRPC (Store and Server clients) |
| PD | `8620` | REST / health probes |
| PD | `8610` | Raft |
| Store | `8500` | gRPC |
| Store | `8510` | Raft |
| Store | `8520` | REST / health probes |
| Server | `8080` | Gremlin and REST API |

All ports are configurable through `values.yaml`. Changing `server.port` updates
the listener, container port, and Service together.

---

### Scheduling

Every component (`pd`, `store`, `server`, `hubble`) exposes the full set of
scheduling controls: `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`, `affinity`,
`topologySpreadConstraints`, and `priorityClassName`. For example, pinning
Store to labeled nodes is just:

```yaml
store:
  nodeSelector:
    hugegraph/role: storage
```

`antiAffinity` (`required` | `preferred` | `disabled`) renders a hostname
pod-anti-affinity preset for `pd`, `store`, and `server`; Hubble has no
`antiAffinity` key because it is single-replica by design. Setting a raw
`affinity` replaces the preset entirely. All three default to `preferred`
(Server always did; the pd and store defaults changed from `required`), so
the chart schedules on clusters with fewer nodes than replicas (including
single-node development clusters). The trade: `preferred` lets the
scheduler co-locate replicas under node pressure, so a single node failure
can then take more than one PD or Store replica with it. Production
clusters with enough nodes should pin `pd.antiAffinity` and
`store.antiAffinity` to `required`, as `values-cluster.yaml` does.

### Partition Sharding

A fresh install seeds PD's persisted configuration with a partition shard
count of 3 when `store.replicas` is at least 3, and 1 otherwise. Without
this the PD image's `conf/application.yml` would pin
`partition.default-shard-count` to 1, leaving chart-deployed clusters
without store-level HA. The derivation never produces 2 because PD clamps a
shard count of 2 to 1: two shards cannot elect a leader.

The chart renders the setting as `-Dpartition.default-shard-count` in the PD
container's `JAVA_OPTS`; system properties outrank the shipped config file,
and the PD start script appends `JAVA_OPTS` after its automatically computed
heap flags, so the image's JVM auto-sizing is unaffected.

**The seed applies at first bootstrap only.** PD persists the shard count
into its own metadata the first time it starts with empty storage, and from
then on the stored value is authoritative: every PD leader change re-reads
it from storage, overwriting whatever the `-D` flag says. Changing
`pd.partition.defaultShardCount` later, or scaling `store.replicas` across
the derivation boundary, therefore has **no** effect on an initialized
cluster. Nor is the value frozen at partition creation: PD reconciles
existing shard groups toward the stored value whenever a partition patrol
runs. To change the shard count of a running cluster, use PD's own config
API (which accepts only odd values not exceeding the live store count) and
then trigger `GET /v1/task/patrolPartitions`; expect shard-group
reallocation when the counts differ.

The shard count also fixes the initial partition count:
`store.replicas x storeMaxShardCount / shardCount`, computed once at
bootstrap. With the image's `store-max-shard-count` default of 12, the
derived shard count moves a default 3-store install from 36 partitions
(shard count 1) to 12 (shard count 3). Set
`pd.partition.storeMaxShardCount` higher to compensate when more partitions
are wanted; it is likewise seeded at first bootstrap only.

An explicit `pd.partition.defaultShardCount` must be odd and at most
`store.replicas`. The chart rejects other values at render time: PD would
silently clamp a value above the live store count, clamp 2 to 1, and reject
even values at its config API, so an accepted render would not mean an
honored setting.

### Disaster Recovery

What PD automates on current builds is narrow. A scheduled patrol runs on a
hardcoded 60-second cadence and only marks Stores that stopped sending
heartbeats as `Offline`; it does not touch partitions. There is **no
automatic re-replication**: re-placing the replicas of a lost Store,
reconciling shard groups against the stored shard count, and processing
tombstoned Stores all run only when a partition patrol is triggered
explicitly. PD's configuration binds `pd.patrol-interval` and
`store.max-down-time` keys, but no code path on current builds reads
either, which is why this chart does not expose them.

Recovery and rebalancing are operator-triggered. PD exposes REST triggers,
reachable through the PD client Service:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n hugegraph svc/hugegraph-pd-client 8620:8620
curl http://127.0.0.1:8620/v1/task/patrolPartitions   # reconcile shard groups, process tombstoned Stores
curl http://127.0.0.1:8620/v1/task/balanceLeaders     # spread Raft leaders
curl http://127.0.0.1:8620/v1/task/balancePartitions  # spread partition data
```

Run `patrolPartitions` after replacing a Store that is not coming back,
`balancePartitions` once the cluster is stable again, and `balanceLeaders`
after restarts that skewed leader placement.

Periodic balancing and shard-sync progress metrics do not exist upstream
yet and are out of scope for this chart. Periodic leader balancing is
tracked in
[apache/hugegraph#3135](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph/issues/3135);
disaster-recovery metrics are tracked in
[apache/hugegraph#3136](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph/issues/3136).

### Scaling

PD and Store reserve the maximum StatefulSet ordinal in their resource names,
so scaling never renames a PersistentVolumeClaim or shifts a Pod identity.
Both are capped at 99 replicas.

Server scales through `server.replicas`, or by enabling `server.hpa`. With HPA
enabled the Deployment omits `spec.replicas`, so a Helm upgrade does not
overwrite the autoscaler's live replica count.

## Troubleshooting

### Store Pods Stuck in `Init:0/1`

The Store init container waits for PD to reach Raft quorum. Check PD first:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/component=pd
kubectl logs <store-pod> -c wait-for-pd
```

The wait is bounded by `store.waitTimeoutSeconds` (default 900). On timeout the
init container exits with a message naming the peers it polled, so the failure
appears in `kubectl describe pod` instead of hanging silently.

### PersistentVolumeClaims Stay `Pending`

No default StorageClass, or the provisioner is unhealthy:

```bash
kubectl get sc
kubectl get pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=<release>
kubectl -n <provisioner-namespace> get pods
```

### Server Ready but Queries Fail

The Server readiness probe uses `/versions`, which can report ready before the
graph is fully able to serve index-backed queries. Confirm the graph is live:

```bash
kubectl exec <server-pod> -c server -- curl -s localhost:8080/graphs
```

### Queries Fail with "Could not rebind" Right After Creating a Graph

**Update (2026-08-12):** [#3138](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph/pull/3138)
merged on `master` and closes Phase 1 of
[#3137](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph/issues/3137). The Server that
handles `CreateGraph` now waits for its own Gremlin binding before returning
HTTP 200, so create-then-query on the **same** Server (or sticky routing to
that Pod) is reliable.

Other Server replicas still converge independently through a PD metadata
watch plus a local graph open. Until they finish, a Gremlin query routed
through the load-balanced Service to a not-yet-converged replica can still
fail with a 400 error such as `Could not rebind [g]`. This is upstream
behavior, not a chart setting. Mitigations for multi-replica load-balanced
deployments:

- Retry with backoff in the client; the window normally closes in seconds.
- Use sticky routing (or `kubectl port-forward` to one Pod) for
  create-then-verify flows.
- Poll `/graphs` on each replica until the new graph appears everywhere
  before opening query traffic.

Cluster-wide readiness and PD-owned graph creation remain tracked in
[#3137](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph/issues/3137) (Phase 2:
[#3139](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph/pull/3139); Phase 3: PD
orchestration).

### Pods OOM Killed or Restarting

The default `values.yaml` sets **no** resource requests or limits and preserves
the image's automatic JVM sizing. Set resources explicitly before production
use; see `values-cluster.yaml`.

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl describe pod <pod> | grep -A5 "Last State"
```

### Release Name Too Long

Helm itself rejects release names longer than 53 characters, before this chart
renders anything:

```text
invalid release name ... the length must not be longer than 53
```

Within that limit the chart is safe: resource names reserve their suffix and
StatefulSet ordinal before truncation, so every generated Service and Pod name
stays inside the 63-character DNS label limit, and PD/Store identities do not
shift when replicas change. Use `fullnameOverride` to shorten generated names
independently of the release name.

---

## Limitations

- No TLS, backups, Operator, multi-cluster support, automatic leader transfer,
  or a complete monitoring stack. Store recovery is manual on current builds:
  re-replication after Store loss, leader balancing, and partition
  rebalancing run only when triggered (see Disaster Recovery); periodic
  balancing and shard-sync metrics are upstream feature work.
- After [#3138](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph/pull/3138), the creating
  Server is consistent at HTTP 200; other replicas may still lag for a short
  window on load-balanced installs (see Troubleshooting: "Could not rebind";
  [#3137](https://github.com/apache/hugegraph/issues/3137) stays open for
  cluster-wide and PD-owned creation).
- The published images run as root, so `runAsNonRoot` and
  `readOnlyRootFilesystem` are not chart defaults. The container
  `securityContext` does default to `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`,
  `capabilities.drop: [ALL]`, and `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`, which are
  valid for a root image; `podSecurityContext` and `securityContext` are fully
  configurable per component.
- `values-cluster.yaml` is a starting point, not a capacity guarantee.
- The auth Secret sets the admin password only at first creation via
  `auth.admin_pa`; the chart cannot rotate an existing cluster's admin
  password.
- With authentication enabled, every Server replica must share one JWT
  signing key. The chart injects `HG_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` from
  `server.auth.token` (chart-managed by default) so Hubble login
  stays stable behind a multi-replica Service.
- Hubble is single-replica, serves plain HTTP, requires `server.auth` to be
  enabled for its login to complete, and keeps UI connection metadata,
  including any graph credentials entered in the UI, in an embedded H2
  database that is lost on Pod replacement unless `hubble.persistence` is
  enabled.
