# Query count and filter behavior

Counts made inside a transaction include that transaction's uncommitted vertex
and edge changes. Only `count()` supports this fallback; other aggregates with
uncommitted changes are rejected. Queries that combine uncommitted changes with
pagination, a limit, or an offset remain unsupported.

Unsupported text predicates remain traversal filters. HugeGraph can still use
label and supported indexed conditions to select candidates, then evaluates the
text predicate locally. A missing required index is still reported as an error.

Partial extraction keeps custom predicates that the backend cannot translate
in traversal filters. Single search predicates use a SEARCH index; mixed search
predicates remain local. UNIQUE indexes are
not used for partial query extraction. For adjacent-edge queries, ordinary
property filters remain in the traversal when a text filter is evaluated locally.

A self-loop contributes two occurrences to a vertex's `bothE()` traversal and
one to each of `outE()`, `inE()` and the graph-wide `E()` traversal. Counts retain
these multiplicities before and after transaction commit, including edge updates.

Count optimization preserves steps that can filter candidates. Resetting an
optimized count traversal permits it to execute again. Query-step equality does
not depend on the result iterator from a previous execution.

A scan in the middle of a traversal is counted once per incoming traverser,
including its bulk. It is not replaced by a single backend count. For example,
with three vertices, `g.V().V().count()` returns `9L`, while `g.V().count()`
returns `3L` and remains eligible for count optimization.

Partial extraction classifies native `Condition.RelationType` predicates with
the same index requirements as TinkerPop predicates: equality and membership
can use secondary indexes, ranges require numeric indexes, and unsupported
relations (including inequality and negative membership) remain local.
