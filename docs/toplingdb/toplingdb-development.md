# ToplingDB Developer Guide

This guide describes the Topling integration maintained in this repository.
Read the [quickstart](toplingdb-quickstart.md) first if you only need to run it.

The runtime support target is native Linux x86_64 and Linux containers on
macOS (Docker Desktop or OrbStack). Native macOS execution, including Intel,
is deliberately outside the ToplingDB matrix; do not treat that CI job as a
Topling image or container failure.

## Runtime Contract

HugeGraph keeps the RocksDB Java API. Topling Easy Migrate supplies the native
runtime and configuration at process startup.

```text
component config
  -> preload-topling.sh validates rocksdb or topling
  -> component-local JAR joins CLASSPATH
  -> component-local native library joins LD_PRELOAD
  -> Easy Migrate YAML is exported
  -> existing RocksDB Java calls open and close DB/CF handles
```

The supported providers are exactly `rocksdb` and `topling`. Duplicate
configuration values must agree. Missing Topling files or dependencies stop
startup. PD and Store never search a neighboring Server distribution.

## Source Layout

| Area | Path |
|---|---|
| Shared helper source | `hugegraph-server/hugegraph-dist/src/assembly/static/bin/common-topling.sh` |
| Package-local preparation | `hugegraph-server/hugegraph-dist/src/assembly/static/bin/prepare-topling.sh` |
| Startup selection | `hugegraph-server/hugegraph-dist/src/assembly/static/bin/preload-topling.sh` |
| Checked-in Topling JAR | `hugegraph-server/hugegraph-dist/src/assembly/static/lib/topling/` |
| Standalone Easy Migrate YAML | `hugegraph-server/hugegraph-dist/src/assembly/static/conf/toplingdb.yaml` |
| PD Easy Migrate YAML | `hugegraph-pd/hg-pd-dist/src/assembly/static/conf/rocksdb_pd.yaml` |
| Store Easy Migrate YAML | `hugegraph-store/hg-store-dist/src/assembly/static/conf/rocksdb_store.yaml` |
| Topling distribution generator | `install-dist/scripts/build-topling-distribution.sh` |
| Provider data marker | `hugegraph-server/hugegraph-dist/src/assembly/static/bin/verify-rocksdb-provider.sh` |
| Docker build graph | `docker/bake.hcl` |
| Focused shell tests | `hugegraph-server/hugegraph-dist/src/assembly/travis/test-topling-*.sh` |

The PD and Store assembly descriptors copy the canonical helper scripts into
their own `bin/` directories. Change the canonical Server copy, then verify all
three assembled copies are identical.

## Build Standard and Topling Distributions

Use Linux x86_64. The distribution generator also requires `rsync`, `unzip`,
`tar`, and `sha256sum`.

```bash
VERSION=$(mvn help:evaluate \
  -Dexpression=project.version -q -DforceStdout)

mvn clean package \
  -pl hugegraph-server/hugegraph-dist,hugegraph-pd/hg-pd-dist,hugegraph-store/hg-store-dist \
  -am -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -ntp

for component in server pd store; do
  install-dist/scripts/build-topling-distribution.sh \
    "$component" "$VERSION"
done
```

The standard distributions contain the selection helpers but no
`lib/topling/rocksdbjni*.jar` or prepared Topling native library. Selecting
Topling from a standard distribution must fail.

When a Topling distribution is switched back to `rocksdb`, the Server launcher
excludes `lib/topling/` from its classpath; the optional Topling JAR is only
added after the startup selector accepts `topling`.

The Topling distributions add only build-time runtime files. The generator
excludes PID files, logs, data directories, and prepared runtime state from the
standard distribution before creating the Topling tarball. It writes
`lib/topling/runtime.properties` with the component, project version, JAR name,
and JAR SHA-256.

That SHA-256 identifies the local input. It is not an official release
signature or a full source-to-binary provenance record. Issue
[#213](https://github.com/hugegraph/hugegraph/issues/213) tracks immutable
coordinates, toolchain and CPU baseline, licensing, SBOM, signatures, and
consumer verification.

## Provider Configuration

Server reads `rocksdb.provider` from graph `.properties` files:

```properties
rocksdb.provider=topling
```

PD and Store read the provider under the root `rocksdb` YAML section:

```yaml
rocksdb:
  provider: topling
```

Keep only one effective value for a component. The loader rejects unknown or
conflicting values. The default is standard RocksDB when no provider is set.

Every Topling functional test must use a readable Easy Migrate YAML. Removing
`TOPLINGDB_EASY_MIGRATE_CONF` reduces a test to Java ABI coverage and does not
exercise the Topling runtime.

## Focused Tests

Run the platform-independent selection and packaging tests first:

```bash
TRAVIS_DIR=hugegraph-server/hugegraph-dist/src/assembly/travis

"$TRAVIS_DIR/test-topling-runtime-selection.sh"
"$TRAVIS_DIR/test-topling-docker-entrypoints.sh"
"$TRAVIS_DIR/test-topling-runtime-packaging.sh" \
  "hugegraph-server/apache-hugegraph-server-$VERSION" \
  "hugegraph-pd/apache-hugegraph-pd-$VERSION" \
  "hugegraph-store/apache-hugegraph-store-$VERSION"
```

On Linux x86_64, validate each generated Topling distribution:

```bash
"$TRAVIS_DIR/test-topling-distribution.sh" \
  server \
  "hugegraph-server/apache-hugegraph-server-$VERSION" \
  "hugegraph-server/apache-hugegraph-server-$VERSION-topling"

"$TRAVIS_DIR/test-rocksdb-runtime.sh" \
  topling \
  "hugegraph-server/apache-hugegraph-server-$VERSION-topling"
```

Repeat the distribution and runtime checks for PD and Store. The CI jobs
`server-rocksdb-runtime` and `distributed-rocksdb-runtime` build a matrix across
standard RocksDB and ToplingDB. Standard runtime checks and both distribution
contracts are required. The synthetic Topling column-family lifecycle check is
reported as a non-blocking diagnostic for issue #212; image-backed service
lifecycle tests remain required. The jobs also contaminate the standard build
with known runtime-state fixtures and verify that the Topling directory and
tarball remain clean.

Run repository checks before pushing:

```bash
mvn editorconfig:check -ntp
mvn clean compile -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -ntp
git diff --check
```

Use ShellCheck on each changed shell script. Existing warnings in untouched
lines do not justify unrelated cleanup in a Topling change.

## Docker Images

Server, PD, and Store Dockerfiles have explicit `standard` and `topling`
targets. Build the complete Topling deployment set with Bake:

```bash
RUNTIME_VARIANT=topling \
IMAGE_TAG=topling \
docker buildx bake --file docker/bake.hcl
```

The Topling variant is Linux x86_64 only. It builds
`hugegraph/hugegraph`, `hugegraph/pd`, and `hugegraph/store` from their
`topling` targets. `hugegraph/server` remains the standard HStore Server and
receives the same tag as the compatible deployment set.

An HStore Server image remains free of a local Topling JAR and native library.
PD and Store own their local runtime.

Published candidates carry `org.opencontainers.image.source`,
`org.opencontainers.image.revision`, and
`org.apache.hugegraph.rocksdb-runtime` labels. Verify the exact source commit
before accepting a mutable deployment tag:

```bash
docker image inspect hugegraph/hugegraph:topling \
  --format '{{json .Config.Labels}}'
```

Run the generic standalone, minimal HStore, or 3+3+3 Compose file with
provider parameters injected through the environment. Local development can
use `local/hugegraph-{pd,store}:topling` with
`HUGEGRAPH_{PD,STORE}_BUILD_TARGET=topling`; published candidates use
`hugegraph/{pd,store}:topling` and `HUGEGRAPH_{PD,STORE}_PULL_POLICY=always`.
Set `HUGEGRAPH_SERVER_IMAGE=hugegraph/server:topling` and
`HUGEGRAPH_SERVER_PULL_POLICY=always` only when the matching HStore image is
intended. Keep the provider-specific volume names and data roots explicit.
The repository deliberately maintains one Compose topology per deployment
shape rather than separate Topling files.

Every local RocksDB owner uses a provider-specific data root. The entrypoint
validates `.hugegraph-rocksdb-provider` before it mutates configuration or
starts Java. Topling rejects unmarked non-empty data. Standard RocksDB accepts
legacy unmarked data, but rejects a Topling marker. The helper rejects symlinked
path components and serializes marker initialization on a pinned directory
inode.

## Native Runtime Changes

When replacing `rocksdbjni*.jar`:

1. Keep exactly one Topling JAR in the checked-in source directory.
2. Run `bin/prepare-topling.sh` in every generated component distribution.
3. Check `ldd library/librocksdbjni-linux64.so` for unresolved dependencies.
4. Run real DB and column-family create, close, reopen, restart, and persistence
   tests with the component Easy Migrate YAML enabled.
5. Record the JAR SHA-256 and the exact source and toolchain evidence available.

Issue [#212](https://github.com/hugegraph/hugegraph/issues/212) tracks native
DB/column-family lifecycle behavior. Real Server and 1+1+1 HStore tests must
cover CRUD, clean HugeGraph transaction close, container recreation, and
persistence. The current native runtime can still report a SidePluginRepo
bookkeeping warning after HugeGraph closes successfully. Keep that upstream
evidence separate from the provider-selection and data-isolation gates. ABI
loading or `ldd` output cannot establish service correctness.

## Review Boundaries

A complete Topling change must keep these properties:

- standard artifacts have no Topling JAR or native library;
- Server, PD, and Store load only their component-local runtime;
- an HStore Server does not load Topling locally;
- standard and Topling data directories stay separate;
- invalid or incomplete Topling selection fails before service startup;
- shutdown uses the normal component lifecycle;
- documentation names the exact configuration file and verification command.

Do not claim hot switching, automatic data migration, safe reuse of a
Topling-modified directory by standard RocksDB, or release provenance that the
artifact metadata does not prove.
